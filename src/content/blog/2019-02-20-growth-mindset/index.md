I’ve had a half-baked blog post sitting in my drafts for 3 days now, but it’s getting harder to write with every new sentence.

I think it’s because at some point it will have to be finished. Then, I’ll have to click the green button up there — “Ready to publish?” — which, honestly, terrifies me. I have never put myself out there on the web or written anything publicly, despite wanting to. I’m either absent or anonymous on social media platforms. On Facebook, I’m a pseudonym with no pictures and an empty wall, too afraid to post anything.

I have chronic anxiety and depression. I manage these illnesses better and better with each day that passes, but I still have difficulty with being confident and drawing attention to myself. I have always struggled with self-esteem, and have long had a fear of being perceived negatively by others, a fear of being wrong, doing wrong, doing something embarrassing, being judged. It’s why I’ve shied away from blogging in the past, and why I hide from social media in general. Why I don’t want to click the green button.

I’m a developer in training at Coder Academy, and it’s Day 3 of our 6-month journey together. Something that has been brought up, time and time again, is the importance of developing your personal brand and being able to network effectively, in order to succeed and get the most out of your career as a dev. The end goal is what I want, but the means of achieving it — by putting myself out there, in public, on the web — is pretty intimidating for someone like me.

In the last 3 days we’ve also learned about growth mindset, an alternative to the fixed mindset that many people, unconsciously, adopt. Growth mindset is about reframing limiting beliefs that we have about ourselves, about our ability to learn and expand our intellect. It’s really encouraging to hear our mentors talk about growth mindset with such passion, especially so early on in the course. For me, it has also been eye-opening.

On the bus home yesterday, I started thinking about the stories we tell ourselves while we’re subscribed to our fixed mindset. Stories that limit us, not just in terms of our academic learning ability (I’m not good at maths) but more generally in how we navigate, learn and grow in our everyday lives (I’m not good enough).

What kind of stories do I tell myself?

I tell myself a story about being a failure, because I dropped out of grad school after four years, and a story about how ashamed I should feel. I tell myself a story about being shy and socially awkward, and why it’s best to keep to myself. I tell myself a story about how embarrassing this blog is, about how cringe all my future posts will be and that I shouldn’t even bother. I tell myself that something’s not worth doing if I can’t do it perfectly. It’s starting to dawn on me that these are just that: stories. Fiction that my mind creates, holding me back from discovering my true self hiding underneath it all — that is, if I believe the stories in the first place.

This blog is the beginning of rejecting that fiction, of buying into another narrative that allows me to become the great developer that I want to be. I welcome the awkwardness of saying or writing silly things, because each and every attempt is an opportunity to do better, and maybe — one day — contribute something important to our world. I welcome embarrassing myself, because there’s no shame in being myself. I look forward to making mistakes: on here, in public, at meetups, in the classroom, wherever, because those mistakes will be the greatest teachers. I am thankful for my past ‘failures’, because they have forced me to tackle new challenges head-on. I am thankful for my struggles with mental health, because through illness I’ve come to understand more fully who I really am. Most importantly, I embody authentic confidence by embracing my vulnerability as a leverage for learning and for growth in all aspects of my life.

My name is Alex, and I will be posting more on here in the weeks to come. I’ll get around to publishing that half-baked blog eventually, where I write about how and why I got into coding before joining Coder Academy, and the process leading up to applying. Stay tuned for blogs about my bootcamp experiences, tutorials and “Things I’ve Learned Today”-type posts as the course progresses, as well as things I’ve been tinkering around with on the side (at the moment, some creative coding in p5.js).
